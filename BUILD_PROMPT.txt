Build a Next.js 14 + Supabase property dashboard app for Anchor Investments, a commercial real estate company.

## Project Context
- 28 properties already extracted to ./data/properties.json
- Supabase credentials are in .env.local (already created, do NOT overwrite)
- This is the full project directory - build everything here

## Data Shape (from properties.json)
Each property has: property_name, date_acquired, original_investment_thesis, owners_intent_10yr, general_notes, occupancy_rate, market_psf_rate, avg_psf_rate, leasing_strategy, vacancies, tenant_mix, renewals, risks, capex_budget (object: year->dollar amount), capex_outlook_summary, long_term_items

## What to Build

### 1. Next.js App
- Scaffold with: npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --app --no-src-dir --import-alias "@/*" --yes
- App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

### 2. Supabase Schema
Create supabase/migrations/001_initial.sql with a properties table (all fields as text or jsonb), plus empty future tables: tenants, leases, loans (each with id + property_id + created_at).

### 3. Seed Script
Create scripts/seed.ts that reads ./data/properties.json and upserts all 28 properties to Supabase using the service role key from .env.local.
Add to package.json scripts: "seed": "ts-node scripts/seed.ts"

### 4. Supabase Client
- lib/supabase.ts: browser client using NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars
- lib/supabase-server.ts: server client using service role key

### 5. Pages

**Portfolio Overview (app/page.tsx)**
- Header: "Anchor Investments - Property Portfolio"
- Summary stats: total properties, avg occupancy, count at 100%, count below 80%
- Grid of property cards showing: name, occupancy (color-coded: green=100%, yellow=80-99%, red=<80%), first upcoming renewal, next capex year+amount
- Cards link to /properties/[slug]

**Property Detail (app/properties/[slug]/page.tsx)**
- Fetch property by slug (slugified name)
- Sections: Overview (occupancy, PSF rates, risks), Leasing (strategy, tenant mix, vacancies, renewals), CapEx (year-by-year table + outlook + long term items), Notes (investment thesis, owner intent, general notes)
- Back to portfolio link

### 6. Design
- Professional dark sidebar layout
- Tailwind only, no external UI libraries
- "Anchor Investments" branding in sidebar
- Mobile responsive

### 7. README.md
Cover: what it is, setup steps, seed instructions, Vercel deploy, future roadmap (tenants/leases/loans).

## Final Step
Run `npm run build` to verify it compiles cleanly.

When completely finished with a successful build, run:
openclaw system event --text "Done: Anchor Dashboard built and verified - ready for Jacob to review" --mode now
